1. Download and install msys2

	https://www.msys2.org/

2. Install mingw-w64, make, and cmake
	
	In mysys2:

	pacman -Syu 
	pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
	pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake

3. Add cmake to the PATH variable

	Open CMD as admin and run:

	setx /M PATH "%PATH%; C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin"

	Start new cmd and run:

	g++
	cmake --version

4. Install sublime text 4

	https://www.sublimetext.com/download

	Press Ctrl + Shift + P to bring up the command palette -> Install package control
	
	Via Package Control, install Icons, PackageResourceViewer

5. Customize Sublime Text // Optional

	a) Remove garbage text from debugging window

		-PackageResourceViewer -> Open Resource -> Default -> exec.py
		-Comment out line 393 #self.write(self.debug_text)

	b) Configure settings

		Add these lines to the settings JSON file

		"file_exclude_patterns":[],
		"word_wrap": true,
		"remember_open_files": false,
		"hot_exit": false

	c) Pick a nice color scheme and theme.

6. Create a project directory
	
	a) Open CMD, navigate to the Desktop and create a Dev folder, and create a Main folder(our project folder)

	mkdir Dev
	cd Dev
	mkdir Main
	cd Main


	b) Run the following commands to create these folders and files:

	mkdir src 
	type nul> CMakeLists.txt
	type nul> toolchain.cmake
	type nul> build.bat
	type nul> run.bat
	type nul> clean.bat

6. Create a Sublime Text project file with cmake, and a build system

	a) Write the CMakeLists.txt file, as follows:

cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 4.1)

project (Main)

#Compiler flags
set (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++17 -m64 -g -Wall -fno-omit-frame-pointer -L ")

set (source_dir "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src")

//We want to output our .exe to the "bin" dir, and if we make any .a or .dll.a files we'll output them to "lib"
set (CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin")
set (CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib")
set (CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib")

#This list should contain all your include directories
set (include_list "")
#list (APPEND include_list "$C:/Foo/include") 


#This list should contain all your link libraries, such as .a files for static linking, and .dll.a files for dynamic linking
#If you have a library installed via MSYS2 you can append it to the list with just -lfoo for example
set (lib_list "")
#list (APPEND lib_list "-lfoo")

file (GLOB_RECURSE source_files "${source_dir}/*.cpp")

add_executable (Main ${source_files})

target_link_libraries(Main PRIVATE ${lib_list})

target_include_directories(Main PRIVATE src ${include_list})



	b) Write the toolchain.cmake file, as follows:

set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR x86_64)

find_program(CMAKE_C_COMPILER NAMES x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc REQUIRED)
find_program(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER NAMES x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ REQUIRED)
find_program(CMAKE_RC_COMPILER NAMES x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres windres REQUIRED)


	c) Write the build.bat file, as follows:

@echo off

cmake . -G "Sublime Text 2 - MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain.cmake
pause


	d) Write the clean.bat file, as follows:

@echo off

del "CMakeCache.txt"
del "Makefile"
del "cmake_install.cmake"

rmdir /s /q "CMakeFiles"

	e) Write the run.bat file, as follows:

@echo off

cd bin
start cmd /c Main


	f) Run the build.bat file to generate the .sublime-project file

	g) Run the clean.bat file to delete the build system we just made, but keep the project file

	h) Edit build.bat and remove the "Sublime Text 2" line from the build command

cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain.cmake

	i) Run build.bat


7. Edit the sublime text project file, and make these changes:

	Rename the first build system to Build, and open a "variants" list which will contain all the others.

	Add a new variant called "Run", and include "&& run" in the command line


8. Setup SDL as an example
	
	a) Download SDL3.

	b) Add these lines to the CMakeList.txt:


set (SDL3_dir "C:/Users/getma/Libraries/SDL3-3.4.0/x86_64-w64-mingw32")

set (SDL3_dir "C:/Users/getma/Libraries/SDL3-3.4.0/x86_64-w64-mingw32")
list (APPEND include_list "${SDL3_dir}/include")

list (APPEND lib_list "${SDL3_dir}/lib/libSDL3.dll.a")

9. Install Jsoncpp with MSYS2 as an example:

	a) In msys2crt, run 

	pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-jsoncpp

	b) Add these lines to CMakeList.txt:


find_package(jsoncpp REQUIRED)

list (APPEND lib_list "jsoncpp_lib")
